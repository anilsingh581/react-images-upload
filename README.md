# React Images Upload
Simple component for upload images with preview built with React.js using FileReader.

The file upload features are very important for web applications. It will help us to facilitate actions like setting a customer profile picture, setting up dynamic galleries, remote file storage, and file sharing, and many other functionalities.

The FileReader object lets web applications asynchronously read the contents of files (or raw data buffers) stored on the user's computer, using File or Blob objects to specify the file or data to read.

# Note -
